## 🚀 Introduction
This project explores **sign language recognition** using deep learning. It includes:
- Preprocessed **datasets**.
- **Model architectures** for gesture classification.
- **Python scripts** for training, testing, and evaluation.

The goal is to make sign language recognition more accessible and provide baseline models for further research.
